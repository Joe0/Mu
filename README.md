##Goals##
Provide a modular, extensible and performance conscious platform.

Completely replicate F2P.

##Big Ideas##
μ heavily uses dependency injection (DI) and aspect-oriented programming (AOP) to achieve its primary goal.

To achieve its secondary goal, it has a DSL that is easily understood by people with little to no programming experience.  The primary language for this is Scala, but remains fully compatible with Java (in the sense that writing plugins in Java doesn't suck or look ugly).

##Documentation##
µ contains documentation in the source code, images detailing the design, videos of it being designed and videos of it being implemented.  Literally everything done is on video.
